## CS224D Deep Learning for NLP

The contents of the problem sets are
[here](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/assignment1/index.html)
with the PDF of the assignment also included in this repository as
assignment1.pdf

## Running
This uses python 2.7. Run the excercises by using python q{1,2,3}_{problem}.py,
basically execute any code by passing the file to the python interpreter.

## Tests
Some of the functionality has tests but some is still missing.

I think there is a large chunk of q3_word2vec.py that can benefit from sanity
tests.
